Week of 4/9/2018:

Matt:  Lots of testing for scripts and other softwares to reproduce the fireball combo in street fighter 2

link to youtube update on combos: https://youtu.be/_QDbjUIh3ug

Kevin: Found new emulator to allow keypresses to be used as input. Allowing for street fighter game use. Attempted to also mkae scripts for street fighter by using real life keyboard timing presses and delays in input, but was unsuccessful doing so. Will finish Myoband mapping if it has not been finished yet.
