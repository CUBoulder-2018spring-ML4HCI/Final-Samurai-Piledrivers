Updates as of 4/1/2018:

Proof of concept has been implemented; it consists of controlling game input and performing a combo in Super Smash Bros with Python.

Nicholas Fentekes researched into methods of implementation; found that controlling keyboard and mouse input directly with 
a Python library, pyautogui, would be a more versatile implementation than hard coding for specific games or emulators.

Matt Kaiser, Tanner Quigley, and Kevin Flynn implemented the proof of concept program, demoing a combo move innitiated with Python.

Robert Perez designed and created a UI.
