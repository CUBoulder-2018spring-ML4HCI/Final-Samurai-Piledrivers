Feedback Notes from class 3/12



Names, duh, title too. 
What games? Pick some specific games. Some that would be easy and some that would be hard. Street fighter and combos, how easy different ‘inputs’ are. 
A lot of games are multi modal, so one to one interaction mappings are not the best idea. Think about menus vs overworld vs minigames. (fallout). 
User interface is huge, as is the mapping of movements. Match hard movements to hard actions in game, (haddouken is difficult, move left is easy)
As such we should restrict the number of games we test on. 
Ethics issues listed aren’t really ethical issues. Check that. 
Concept phase, nail down games you will use, training process, 
What is our meeting time? 
What are the steps that we need to take
Plan out the project in very concrete steps. 
Make a debugging interface like a pseudo-game to develop the controller
Check menu screens to change the controls. This could be done via webcam on the game screen or by the music that it plays.
Make profiles of 

Meeting times:
Tues/Thurs 5-whenever PM.

Schedule:
	
What we need to get done:
Figure out precisely what hardware we want to use.
Things that could work
Eyebrow tracking
Foot pedal
Chest in and out
Perhaps leap motion might work though with head tilt


Things that won’t work
Eye tracking b/c gaze should be on game
Leap motion would be exhausting, 
What games we want to test this on 
How to interface to said games
Interfacing with the user
Intuitive model building with the user. 

Check out tool assisted speedrun, and break apart a controller to solder in an arduino to activate the buttons.
