# Final-Samurai-Piledrivers
Control specific games with controller for different abilities of movement 
## What still needs to get done: 
- Break the infinite loop that gives final output on launch game button. Ideally this breaks with an escape key
- Get recording control implemented for the 'build schema' option. 
- Get python to take data from advice and format
- make Python send to Wek.
- Make different wekinator models loadable from UI.
